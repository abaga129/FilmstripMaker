FilmstripMaker
**********************************************

This is a simple program for making a filmstrip from
a set of images.

Why?
I created this to aid in creating GUIs for audio plugins
and other similar applications. I couldn't find a program
anywhere that would stitch a series of images together to
make a filmstrip.

This uses the free open source library opencv.

What I would like to improve:

Add an option to create a horizontal strip instead of
the vertical strip.

Fix the problem where transparency in images is white
in the output image.
