FilmstripMaker
**********************************************

This is a simple cross-platform command line utility for making a filmstrip from
a set of images.

Why?
I created this to aid in creating GUIs for audio plugins
and other similar applications. I couldn't find a program
anywhere that would stitch a series of images together to
make a filmstrip, so I created a tool to do it.

This uses the free open source library opencv.
